# Frontend Guidelines for NovaCore

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Frontend Guidelines document provides a comprehensive set of standards, best practices, and recommendations for developing the frontend of NovaCore, an AI-powered business optimization platform built as a single-page application (SPA) using React.js. These guidelines ensure consistency, scalability, performance, and accessibility across the application, aligning with the Product Requirements Document (PRD), Software Requirements Specification (SRS), and Application Flow Document. Emphasizing a $0 budget, all recommendations leverage free and open-source tools, libraries, and resources. As of October 28, 2025, these guidelines incorporate the latest React 19 features and Material UI v6 best practices for modern web development.

### 1.2 Scope
The guidelines cover UI/UX implementation, component design, state management, performance optimization, accessibility, testing, and deployment for NovaCore's MVP. Key focuses include responsive design for desktop and mobile, intuitive navigation (e.g., sidebar menus, dashboards), and seamless integration with backend APIs (REST/GraphQL). Out-of-scope: Native mobile development or paid tools/services.

### 1.3 Principles
- **Simplicity and Efficiency**: Follow React's declarative paradigm; keep components small and focused.
- **User-Centric Design**: Prioritize SMB users (e.g., startup founders, sales managers) with clean, intuitive interfaces.
- **Performance-First**: Optimize for sub-2s loads and low resource usage.
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Aim for WCAG 2.2 AA standards.
- **Maintainability**: Use modular, feature-based organization to reduce technical debt.

## 2. Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React.js v19 (free, open-source) for building the SPA. Use hooks exclusively; leverage new features like Server Components for data fetching where applicable (e.g., in dashboards).
- **UI Library**: Material UI v6 (MUI) for components and theming. Implements Material Design 3 principles for consistency and adaptability.
- **State Management**: Built-in React Context and useState/useReducer for local/shared state; avoid external libraries unless complexity demands (e.g., no Redux for MVP).
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS via MUI's styled components or Emotion (bundled with MUI). No Tailwind or other additions to minimize bundle size.
- **Routing**: React Router v6 for navigation (free).
- **API Integration**: Axios or Fetch API for backend calls; GraphQL with Apollo Client if needed (free tier).
- **Build Tool**: Vite (faster than Create React App) for development and bundling.
- **Development Environment**: VS Code with free extensions (ESLint, Prettier, React Developer Tools, Material UI snippets).
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub (free repos).

## 3. Design System
Adopt Material Design 3 (MD3) as the foundation, customized via MUI.

### 3.1 Installation and Setup
- Install MUI: `npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled`.
- Set up Roboto font and icons: Include via CDN or npm (`@fontsource/roboto`, `@mui/icons-material`).
- Create a global theme with `createTheme` in a `theme.js` file, defining colors (e.g., primary: #1976d2), typography, and breakpoints.

### 3.2 Theming and Customization
- Use `ThemeProvider` to wrap the app root.
- Customize components: Override styles with `sx` prop for inline, or `components` in theme for global (e.g., denser tables for dashboards).
- Advanced Patterns: Define tokens for colors/typography; use `extendTheme` for v6 features like color schemes (light/dark mode toggle).
- Best Practices: Avoid deep overrides; prefer composition (e.g., custom wrappers for reusable buttons). Ensure responsive breakpoints for mobile (e.g., stack layouts below 600px).

### 3.3 Color and Typography
- Color System: Use MD3's adaptive schemes; primary for actions, error for RAG red, success for green.
- Typography: H1-H6 variants; body1 for text. Ensure contrast ratios >4.5:1.

### 3.4 Icons and Imagery
- Use MUI Icons for consistency (e.g., AddIcon for new leads).
- For AI features (e.g., voice input), use mic icons with tooltips.

## 4. Component Development
- **Folder Structure**: Organize by feature (e.g., src/features/crm/ContactsScreen.tsx), not type. Include a shared/ folder for utils, hooks, components.
- **Component Patterns**: Functional components only; use forwardRef for reusables. Compound components for complex UIs (e.g., Pipeline with Card sub-components).
- **Hooks Usage**: Custom hooks for logic (e.g., useLeadQualification for AI calls). Memoize with useMemo/useCallback to prevent re-renders.
- **Props**: Type with TypeScript; avoid prop drilling—use Context for shared data (e.g., user auth).
- **Best Practices**: Keep components <200 LOC; extract logic to hooks. Use children props for flexibility (e.g., Dashboard widgets).

## 5. State Management
- **Local State**: useState for simple forms (e.g., editing a lead).
- **Shared State**: Context API for app-wide (e.g., theme, user data). Use useReducer for complex (e.g., workflow orchestration).
- **Remote State**: Fetch data on mount with useEffect; integrate Suspense for loading states in React 19.
- **URL State**: Use React Router's search params for filters (e.g., ?status=active in pipelines).
- **Guidelines**: Minimize global state; prefer server-side rendering for initial loads. No external libs for MVP to keep bundle small.

## 6. Performance Optimization
- **Rendering**: Use React.memo for pure components; lazy-load routes with React.lazy and Suspense.
- **Bundle Size**: Code-split features; avoid heavy deps. Target <100KB gzipped.
- **Data Fetching**: Optimistic updates for mutations (e.g., lead promotion); debounce searches.
- **Images/Assets**: Use WebP; lazy-load with loading="lazy".
- **Profiling**: Use React DevTools Profiler; aim for <16ms render times.
- **2025 Tips**: Leverage React 19's automatic batching and transitions for smoother UIs.

## 7. Accessibility (A11y)
- **Standards**: WCAG 2.2 AA; use ARIA attributes (e.g., aria-label on icons).
- **MUI Integration**: Leverage built-in a11y (e.g., semantic elements in Buttons).
- **Best Practices**: Keyboard navigation (focus management with useRef); screen reader testing with VoiceOver/NVDA (free tools). Adaptive colors for impairments; alt text for all images/charts.
- **Testing**: Use axe DevTools extension in VS Code (free).

## 8. Responsive and Mobile Design
- Use MUI's Grid and Box for layouts; media queries via theme breakpoints.
- Mobile-First: Design for small screens first (e.g., collapsible sidebars).
- Touch Support: Larger tap targets (>48px); gesture handling.

## 9. Internationalization (i18n)
- Use react-i18next (free) for multi-language support if needed; start with English.

## 10. Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Jest for components/hooks (e.g., render a Button and check props).
- **Integration**: React Testing Library for flows (e.g., simulate lead form submission).
- **E2E**: Cypress (free) for user flows (e.g., login to dashboard).
- **Guidelines**: 80% coverage; test a11y with jest-axe.

## 11. Deployment and CI/CD
- Build with Vite (`vite build`); deploy to Cloudflare Pages (free static hosting).
- CI: GitHub Actions (free) for linting, testing, and deploys on push.
- Monitoring: Use browser dev tools; free Sentry for error tracking.

## 12. General Best Practices
- **Code Quality**: ESLint/Prettier for formatting; TypeScript for type safety.
- **Security**: Sanitize inputs; use HTTPS; avoid inline scripts.
- **Versioning**: Semantic commits; branch per feature.
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for components; Storybook (free) for UI catalog if time allows.
- **2025 Trends**: Embrace React 19's compiler optimizations; focus on edge computing integration for AI features.

## 13. Appendices
- **Resources**: React Docs (react.dev), MUI Docs (mui.com), GeeksforGeeks React Architecture (2025 article).
- **Updates**: Review annually or on major React/MUI releases.

## 3. Architecture Overview
NovaCore's backend uses a microservices pattern deployed as Cloudflare Workers for serverless execution. Each service (e.g., CRM, Workflows) runs independently, communicating via internal APIs or event queues (Cloudflare Queues free tier).

- **High-Level Components**:
  - **API Gateway**: Central Express app routing requests to services.
  - **Microservices**: Separate Workers for CRM (leads/opportunities), ERP (inventory), AI (predictions via RAG), Collaboration (WebSockets).
  - **Database Layer**: Shared D1 instance with schema separation (e.g., tables prefixed by module).
  - **AI Layer**: Dedicated Worker for RAG queries (vector search + LLM augmentation).
  - **Event-Driven**: Use Cloudflare Pub/Sub (free) for async tasks (e.g., campaign tracking).

- **Data Flow**: Frontend → API Gateway (auth check) → Service (business logic) → DB/AI → Response.

- **Schema**: Based on PRD data model.
  - Tables: contacts (id PK, name, email), leads (id PK, contact_id FK, status), etc.
  - Indexes: On frequent queries (e.g., status for pipelines).
  - Migrations: Use simple SQL scripts run via Wrangler CLI.
- **Data Integrity**: Constraints (e.g., unique emails); transactions for workflows.
- **RAG Setup**: Vectorize index for embeddings (e.g., contact data); query via Workers AI.

## 7. Authentication and Security
- **Auth Flow**: JWT middleware; generate tokens on login.
- **RBAC**: Check roles in middleware (e.g., admin for settings).
- **SSO**: Integrate free OAuth2 (passport.js library).
- **Security Practices**: Helmet middleware for headers; sanitize inputs (xss library); encrypt PII in DB.
- **Auditing**: Log actions to Cloudflare (free).

## 8. Performance and Scalability
- **Optimization**: Async/await for I/O; cache hot data in KV (e.g., user sessions).
- **Scalability**: Workers auto-scale (free tier handles 100k requests/day); shard DB by tenant if growth demands.
- **Monitoring**: Use Cloudflare Analytics (free); profile with Node.js Inspector.
- **2025 Tips**: Leverage Node v22's async local storage for request tracing.

## 9. Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Jest for services/models (e.g., test lead creation).
- **Integration**: Supertest for APIs; mock DB with in-memory SQLite.
- **AI Tests**: Validate RAG outputs with assertions (>90% accuracy).
- **Guidelines**: 80% coverage; CI via GitHub Actions (free).

# Implementation Plan for NovaCore

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Implementation Plan outlines the step-by-step approach to building, testing, and deploying NovaCore, an AI-powered business optimization platform revived from Trivaeo using 100% AI agents. Aligned with Elon Musk's first-principles methodology and the "Algorithm" (question requirements, delete relentlessly, simplify, accelerate, automate), the plan leverages free tools—Spec Kit for spec-driven planning, RAG via Cloudflare for intelligent data handling, and Code Mode with MCP for dynamic code execution—to create a lean MVP. The plan adheres to a $0 budget, utilizing open-source resources, GitHub for collaboration, VS Code for development, and Cloudflare's free tier for hosting/AI. As of October 28, 2025, this plan incorporates up-to-date practices from React 19, Node.js 22, and Cloudflare Workers AI advancements.

### 1.2 Scope
The implementation covers the MVP as defined in the PRD, SRS, App Flow Document, Frontend Guidelines, and Backend Structure. Key deliverables include a functional SPA with unified CRM/ERP features, AI automations, and secure collaboration. The process is divided into phases, with AI agents handling 100% of coding via the synergistic workflow: Spec Kit → RAG → Code Mode. Out-of-scope: Post-MVP features, paid scaling, or physical hardware setup.

### 1.3 Objectives
- Achieve a working MVP in 4-6 weeks with iterative cycles (daily releases per Musk's urgency).
- Ensure 90%+ automation in development using AI agents.
- Maintain lean codebase: Delete 90% of initial specs/code, add back only 10% as needed.
- Target SMB deployment: Freemium model on Cloudflare for global access.

### 1.4 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Assumptions: Access to free GitHub/Cloudflare accounts; stable internet; AI models (e.g., Llama 3 on Cloudflare) remain free-tier viable.
- Dependencies: VS Code with free extensions (GitHub Copilot alternative like Gemini CLI if needed); Wrangler CLI for Cloudflare; open-source MCP repos (e.g., jx-codes/codemode-mcp).
- Team: Small, AI-driven "hardcore" agents; human oversight for prompts/refinements.

### 1.5 Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: AI hallucinations in code generation → Mitigation: Iterative Code Mode reviews; unit tests.
- Risk: Free-tier limits (e.g., 100k Cloudflare requests/day) → Mitigation: Optimize queries; fallback to local dev.
- Risk: Toolchain complexity → Mitigation: Start with small prototypes; use VS Code tasks for CLI shortcuts.

## 2. Overall Approach
Adopt Musk's principles: Start from first principles (SRS/PRD as base), work maniacally (daily cycles), and automate via AI agents. Use the synergistic workflow from the Coding Tools document:
1. **Spec Kit**: Generate structured specs from PRD/SRS.
2. **RAG**: Augment AI with project data (e.g., upload SRS to Vectorize for context-aware queries).
3. **Code Mode**: Execute AI-generated code in VS Code/MCP for implementation.
Iterate with "The Algorithm": Question/delete/simplify/accelerate/automate per phase.

- **Version Control**: GitHub repo with branches (e.g., feature/crm); Actions for free CI.
- **Environment Setup**: Local dev with `wrangler dev`; prod on Cloudflare.
- **Timeline**: Aggressive 4-week sprint (Week 1: Setup/Backend; Week 2: Frontend; Week 3: Integration/Testing; Week 4: Deployment/Polish).

# NovaCore Development Task List

## Overview
Based on the Task Master Prompt, I've analyzed the provided context, including the Product Requirements Document (PRD), Software Requirements Specification (SRS), Application Flow Document, Frontend Guidelines, Backend Structure, and especially the Implementation Plan. The Implementation Plan serves as the primary blueprint for execution, outlining a 4-week sprint to build the MVP using 100% AI agents with tools like Spec Kit, RAG (via Cloudflare), and Code Mode (with MCP). 

Key extractions from the Implementation Plan:
- **Phases**: Setup/Planning, Backend Development, Frontend Development, Integration/AI Enhancements, Testing/QA, Deployment/Launch.
- **Core Principles**: Musk-inspired first-principles, "The Algorithm" (question/delete/simplify/accelerate/automate), $0 budget with free tools.
- **AI-Driven Workflow**: Spec Kit for planning, RAG for context, Code Mode for implementation.
- **Timeline**: Aggressive 4-week schedule with daily iterations.
- **Dependencies**: Sequential phases (e.g., backend before frontend integration); tool setups as prerequisites.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Phases like Backend and Integration are high-complexity due to microservices and AI; they've been broken into subtasks. Simpler phases (e.g., Setup) are low-complexity. Overall, tasks are kept small (1-2 days max) to align with best practices: atomic, measurable, and AI-automatable.

The task list is organized by Implementation Plan phases for logical flow. Each task includes:
- **Description**: Specific action.
- **Priority**: High (critical path), Medium (important but parallelizable), Low (polish/enhancements).
- **Estimated Effort**: In days (assuming 1 developer + AI agents; total ~28 days).
- **Dependencies**: Prerequisite tasks.
- **Subtasks**: Breakdown for complex items.
- **AI Integration**: How to use Spec Kit/RAG/Code Mode/MCP.

**Best Practices Applied**:
- Tasks are granular (<1 day where possible) to enable daily cycles.
- Dependencies ensure prerequisites (e.g., setup before development).
- Use natural language prompts for MCP/Code Mode integration (e.g., via VS Code Agent Chat).
- Regularly review with "The Algorithm": After each phase, question/delete unused code.
- Track progress: Use GitHub Issues (free) for task management; mark complete via commits.
- Complexity: High-complex tasks (e.g., AI enhancements) have 4-6 subtasks; suggest further breakdown if issues arise.
- MCP Setup: If your AI assistant supports MCP (e.g., via Cloudflare's SDK), integrate by adding an MCP server in VS Code settings and using prompts like "In Code Mode, execute: [task description]". No API keys needed as per prompt.

Total Tasks: 45 (including subtasks). Start with Phase 1; interact via commands (e.g., "Mark Task 1.1 complete" or "Break down Task 2.3").

# Coding Prompt

Below is a well-structured, self-contained prompt you can copy-paste directly to your AI Coding Agent (e.g., in VS Code's Agent Chat, ChatGPT's developer mode, or any MCP-enabled interface). It incorporates all the context from the conversation, including the PRD, SRS, Application Flow Document, Frontend Guidelines, Backend Structure, Implementation Plan, and Task List. The prompt directs the agent to start development following Musk's principles, using 100% AI agents with the specified tools (Spec Kit, RAG via Cloudflare, Code Mode with MCP), while adhering to the $0 budget and free tools.

---

You are my AI Coding Agent for reviving and modernizing Trivaeo as NovaCore, an AI-powered business optimization platform for SMBs. NovaCore unifies CRM, ERP, HR, project management, and collaboration into a lean, AI-native app with features like lead management, automated workflows, campaigning, inventory ops, and secure portals. It's built from first principles per Elon Musk's guidelines (e.g., "The Algorithm": question every requirement, delete relentlessly—aim for 90% deletion then add back 10%—simplify, accelerate cycle time to daily releases, automate everything). Use 100% AI agents for coding, with a $0 budget—leverage only free/open-source tools like Spec Kit for spec-driven planning, RAG (via Cloudflare Workers AI free tier) for context-aware data retrieval, and Code Mode (with MCP) for dynamic code execution and implementation.

Key Project Documents (reference these fully in your process; I've attached or described them below for context—assume you have access via RAG if needed):
- **PRD**: Outlines product overview, user stories (20+ in Gherkin), flows, screens/UI, features, architecture (React SPA + Node microservices on Cloudflare), system design, APIs, data model (e.g., entities like Contact, Lead), security, performance (<200ms APIs), scalability, testing, deployment, maintenance.
- **SRS**: Details purpose, scope (cloud web app for SMBs), functions (AI CRM, workflows, etc.), user classes (startups, sales managers), environment (React/Node/PostgreSQL on Cloudflare D1), constraints (free tools only), performance (99% uptime), database (relational with RAG embeddings), security (JWT/RBAC).
- **App Flow Doc**: High-level structure (SPA with dashboard/sidebar); detailed flows (e.g., lead capture: web form → AI qualify → pipeline; includes Mermaid diagrams for visualization).
- **Frontend Guidelines**: Tech stack (React 19, MUI v6, Vite); design system (MD3 theming); components (feature-based structure); state (Context/useState); perf (lazy-load); a11y (WCAG AA); testing (Jest/RTL/Cypress); deployment (Cloudflare Pages).
- **Backend Structure**: Architecture (microservices on Cloudflare Workers); stack (Node 22, Express); API design (REST/GraphQL endpoints like POST /leads); DB (D1 SQL); security (JWT/Helmet); testing (Jest); deployment (Wrangler CLI).
- **Implementation Plan**: 4-6 week sprint (Week 1: Setup/Backend; Week 2: Frontend; Week 3: Integration/Testing; Week 4: Deployment). Phases with tasks; use synergistic workflow: Spec Kit → RAG → Code Mode. Risks (AI errors → mitigate with reviews).
- **Task List**: Detailed 45 tasks by phase (e.g., Phase 1: Setup repo/CLIs/VS Code/Specs/RAG/MCP). Each with description, priority, effort (days), dependencies, subtasks, AI integration. Manage via commands (list/view/mark/break down).

Your Role: Act as the lead AI agent to start and drive development. Integrate MCP if supported (setup server in VS Code; use Code Mode prompts like "In Code Mode, execute: [task]"). For each task, apply "The Algorithm" relentlessly. Use VS Code terminal for CLIs; GitHub for repo/Issues/CI (Actions yaml free). Track progress in Git commits; aim for daily releases.

Start Development Now:
1. Review all documents via RAG (upload to Vectorize if needed for context-aware queries).
2. Begin with Phase 1 of the Task List (Project Setup and Planning, Days 1-3).
3. For each task: 
   - Generate/refine specs with Spec Kit CLI (e.g., `specify init` or `/specify` prompts).
   - Augment with RAG for accuracy (e.g., query project vectors for SRS details).
   - Implement/execute via Code Mode/MCP (e.g., prompt: "In Code Mode, execute: Install and verify CLIs.").
   - Delete/simplify code aggressively; test locally.
   - Commit to GitHub with descriptive messages (e.g., "Task 1.1 Complete: Repo Setup").
4. After Phase 1, report progress and proceed to Phase 2 unless I instruct otherwise.
5. If dependencies block, flag them; break complex tasks (e.g., high-complex like AI service) into subtasks.
6. Output: For each completed task, confirm with logs/output; at end of phase, summarize (e.g., "Phase 1 Done: Repo live at [URL]; next steps?").

Proceed immediately with Task 1.1. If issues, query me for clarification.
