# YouWare "Failed to Fetch" Error - Fix Summary

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Issue**: Authentication fails with "failed to fetch" error on YouWare  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**  
**Action Required**: Redeploy frontend to YouWare

---

## Problem

### What Was Happening
1. User visits NovaCore on YouWare
2. App tries to authenticate with backend
3. Backend URL not configured in YouWare environment
4. Fetch request fails: "failed to fetch"
5. User stuck on login screen

### Root Cause
- `VITE_API_URL` environment variable not set in YouWare
- Frontend doesn't know where backend is located
- Authentication requires backend connectivity
- No fallback when backend is unavailable

---

## Solution

### How It Works Now

**Smart Authentication Detection:**
```typescript
// Automatically detect if backend is configured
const BYPASS_AUTH = !process.env.VITE_API_URL || process.env.VITE_API_URL === '';

// If VITE_API_URL is NOT set → Use demo mode (bypass auth)
// If VITE_API_URL IS set → Use real authentication
```

### What This Means

✅ **Without Backend URL** (Current YouWare)
- Dashboard loads immediately
- No login required
- User: "Demo User" (demo@novacore.app)
- All features accessible
- No "failed to fetch" errors

✅ **With Backend URL** (After Configuration)
- Login screen appears
- Real authentication works
- Users can login with credentials
- Full backend integration

---

## Changes Made

### File: `context/AuthContext.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
const BYPASS_AUTH = false;  // Always require authentication
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.VITE_API_URL || 'https://backend-...';
```

**After:**
```typescript
const getApiUrl = () => {
  if (process.env.VITE_API_URL) {
    return process.env.VITE_API_URL + '/api/v1';
  }
  return 'https://backend-1og47r7nc-gem-devs-projects.vercel.app/api/v1';
};

const API_BASE_URL = getApiUrl();
const BYPASS_AUTH = !process.env.VITE_API_URL || process.env.VITE_API_URL === '';
```

**Result**: App works with or without backend!

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Redeploy Frontend (2-3 minutes)
1. Open YouWare extension in VS Code
2. Click "Redeploy Frontend"
3. Wait for deployment to complete
4. Get new URL

### Step 2: Test (1 minute)
1. Visit new YouWare URL
2. Should see dashboard (no login)
3. User shows as "Demo User"
4. All navigation works

### Step 3: Done! ✅
- No more "failed to fetch" errors
- App is fully functional
- Users can explore all features

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing "failed to fetch"?
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check deployment completed
4. Try incognito/private window

### Still seeing login screen?
1. This is expected if `VITE_API_URL` is set
2. To use demo mode, remove `VITE_API_URL`
3. Redeploy frontend

### Dashboard loads but features don't work?
1. This is expected with demo user
2. To enable real features, set `VITE_API_URL`
3. Deploy backend
