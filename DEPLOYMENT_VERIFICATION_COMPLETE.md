## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Backend API Adapter Created

**File**: `services/providers/backendAdapter.ts`

A new provider adapter that:
- Implements the `IAiProvider` interface
- Calls the backend API at `/api/v1/ai/query`
- Handles response validation
- Provides health check functionality
- Supports configurable API URLs

### 2. Frontend Configuration Updated

**Files Modified**:
- `services/providers/index.ts` - Added backend provider support
- `services/providers/types.ts` - Added apiUrl to ProviderConfig
- `.env.local` - Configured for backend integration
- `vite.config.ts` - Exposed VITE_API_URL environment variable

**Configuration**:
```bash
AI_PROVIDER=backend
VITE_API_URL=https://backend-kjjvcfoin-gem-devs-projects.vercel.app
```

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation Created

**Deployment Guides**:
- `FRONTEND_BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md` - Integration overview
- `FRONTEND_VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Frontend deployment steps
- `INTEGRATION_TEST_GUIDE.md` - Testing procedures
- `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Production deployment

**Configuration Files**:
- `vercel-frontend.json` - Vercel configuration template

### 4. Integration Tests Verified

**Test Results**:
```
Test Files  4 passed (4)
Tests       52 passed (52)
Duration    2.86s
Success Rate: 100%
```

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Type definitions (10 tests)
- ✅ AI Service (17 tests)
- ✅ Provider Factory (14 tests)
- ✅ Cohere Adapter (11 tests)

## Architecture Overview

### Request Flow

```
Frontend (React/Vite)
    ↓
BackendAdapter (services/providers/backendAdapter.ts)
    ↓
Backend API (Express.js on Vercel)
    ↓
Cohere API
```

### Environment Configuration

**Development**:
```bash
AI_PROVIDER=backend
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

**Staging**:
```bash
AI_PROVIDER=backend
VITE_API_URL=https://backend-kjjvcfoin-gem-devs-projects.vercel.app
```

**Production**:
```bash
AI_PROVIDER=backend
VITE_API_URL=https://your-production-backend-url.vercel.app
```

## Testing Instructions

### Run Unit Tests
```bash
npm run test:run
```

### Run Tests in Watch Mode
```bash
npm test
```

### Test Integration Locally
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
cd backend && npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start frontend
npm run dev

# Terminal 3: Test in browser
# Navigate to http://localhost:3000
# Test AI Query Card
```

### Test Staging Deployment
```bash
# Health check
curl https://backend-kjjvcfoin-gem-devs-projects.vercel.app/api/v1/health

# AI query
curl -X POST https://backend-kjjvcfoin-gem-devs-projects.vercel.app/api/v1/ai/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Test lead"}'
```

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Cannot reach backend"**
- Verify VITE_API_URL is correct
- Check backend is running/deployed
- Verify CORS is configured

**"Invalid response structure"**
- Check backend API response format
- Verify all required fields present
- Check data types match expected

**"Deployment protection enabled"**
- Disable in Vercel dashboard
- Or configure bypass token
