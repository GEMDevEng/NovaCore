# Staging Deployment Guide - Railway

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Date**: 2025-10-29  
**Platform**: Railway  
**Environment**: Staging

---

## Overview

This guide documents the deployment of the NovaCore backend to Railway's staging environment. Railway provides a free tier suitable for testing and staging deployments.

---

## Prerequisites

- Railway account (free at https://railway.app)
- GitHub account (for connecting repository)
- Cohere API key (from `.env.local`)
- Node.js 18+ (for local testing)

---

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create Railway Account

1. Visit https://railway.app
2. Click "Start Project"
3. Sign up with GitHub (recommended for easy integration)
4. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub account

### Step 2: Create New Project

1. Click "New Project" in Railway dashboard
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Search for and select `NovaCore` repository
4. Click "Deploy"

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Railway will automatically detect the Node.js project. Now configure environment variables:

1. In Railway dashboard, go to your project
2. Click on the "Backend" service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add the following environment variables:

```
COHERE_API_KEY=dyfJLrucN9sINeHUyWKhflGuoJPIltrLdYVZdA9u
NODE_ENV=staging
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Important**: 
- `PORT` is automatically assigned by Railway (no need to set)
- `NODE_ENV=staging` enables staging-specific logging
- `FRONTEND_URL` can be updated later when frontend is deployed

### Step 4: Configure Build Settings

1. In Railway dashboard, go to "Settings" tab
2. Set the following:
   - **Root Directory**: `backend`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
   - **Build Command**: `npm install` (optional, Railway auto-detects)

### Step 5: Deploy

1. Railway automatically deploys when you push to GitHub
2. Or manually trigger deployment:
   - Click "Deploy" button in Railway dashboard
   - Wait for build to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)

### Step 6: Get Staging URL

1. After deployment completes, go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Copy the public URL (format: `https://novacore-backend-staging.railway.app`)
4. This is your **Staging Backend URL**

---

## Staging Backend URL

```
https://novacore-backend-staging.railway.app
```

**Note**: Replace with actual URL after deployment

---

## Testing Staging Endpoints

## Redeployment Process

### Automatic Redeployment

Railway automatically redeploys when you push changes to the main branch:

```bash
# Make changes locally
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Update backend feature"
git push origin main

# Railway automatically detects and deploys
# Check deployment status in Railway dashboard
```

### Manual Redeployment

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click "Redeploy" button
4. Wait for deployment to complete

### Rollback to Previous Deployment

1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Find the previous working deployment
3. Click "Rollback" button
4. Confirm rollback

---

## Environment Variables Configuration

5. Edit or add variables
6. Changes take effect on next deployment

---

## Monitoring and Logs

### View Logs

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click on "Backend" service
4. Go to "Logs" tab
5. View real-time logs

### Common Log Messages

```
âœ… NovaCore Backend running on http://localhost:3001
ðŸ“š API Documentation: http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health
ðŸ”Œ AI Endpoints: http://localhost:3001/api/v1/ai
ðŸ‘¥ Leads Endpoints: http://localhost:3001/api/v1/leads
```

### Error Monitoring

- Check logs for any error messages
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure Cohere API key is valid
- Check CORS configuration for frontend URL

---

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment Failed

**Problem**: Build fails during deployment

**Solution**:
1. Check logs in Railway dashboard
2. Verify `backend/package.json` exists
3. Ensure Node.js version is 18+
4. Check for syntax errors in code

### Health Check Fails

**Problem**: `/api/v1/health` returns error

**Solution**:
1. Verify backend is running: Check logs
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check Cohere API key is valid
4. Verify network connectivity

### AI Query Returns Error

**Problem**: `/api/v1/ai/query` returns error

**Solution**:
1. Verify `COHERE_API_KEY` is set correctly
2. Check Cohere API status at https://status.cohere.com
3. Verify prompt is valid JSON
4. Check logs for detailed error message

### CORS Errors

**Problem**: Frontend cannot reach backend

**Solution**:
1. Update `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable
2. Ensure frontend URL is correct
3. Check browser console for CORS error details
4. Verify backend is accessible from frontend

---

## Performance Considerations

### Response Times

- **Health Check**: <100ms
- **AI Query**: 200-500ms (depends on Cohere API)
- **Lead Operations**: <50ms
- **Batch Queries**: 500-2000ms (depends on batch size)

### Scaling

Railway automatically scales based on traffic:
- Free tier: Limited resources
- Paid tier: Scalable resources
- Monitor usage in Railway dashboard

---

## Security

### API Key Management

- âœ… Cohere API key stored in Railway environment variables
- âœ… Never commit API keys to repository
- âœ… Use `.env.local` for local development only
- âœ… Rotate API keys periodically

### CORS Configuration

- âœ… CORS enabled for specified frontend URL
- âœ… Credentials allowed for authenticated requests
- âœ… Update `FRONTEND_URL` when deploying frontend

### HTTPS

- âœ… Railway provides HTTPS by default
- âœ… All traffic encrypted in transit
- âœ… SSL certificate auto-renewed

---

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

- [ ] Monitor logs for errors
- [ ] Check API response times
- [ ] Verify health endpoints
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Review and rotate API keys quarterly

### Backup and Recovery

- Railway automatically backs up deployments
- Previous deployments available for rollback
- No manual backup needed for staging

---

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Deploy backend to Railway
2. âœ… Test all endpoints
3. â†’ Update frontend to use staging backend URL
4. â†’ Deploy frontend to staging
5. â†’ Run integration tests
6. â†’ Deploy to production
