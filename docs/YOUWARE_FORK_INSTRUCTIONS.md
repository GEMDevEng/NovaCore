# Creating a Separate Fork for YouWare Publishing

## Overview

This guide explains how to create a separate fork/repository of NovaCore specifically optimized for YouWare platform publishing.

## Why a Separate Fork?

- **Isolation**: Keep YouWare-specific configurations separate from main project
- **Flexibility**: Customize for YouWare without affecting main repository
- **Versioning**: Maintain different versions for different platforms
- **Community**: Share YouWare-optimized version with the community

## Step 1: Create New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `NovaCore-YouWare` (or similar)
3. Description: "NovaCore optimized for YouWare platform publishing"
4. Visibility: Public (to share with community)
5. Initialize with README
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Clone and Mirror Original Repository

```bash
# Clone the original NovaCore as a mirror
git clone --mirror https://github.com/GEMDevEng/NovaCore.git NovaCore-mirror.git

# Push to new repository
cd NovaCore-mirror.git
git push --mirror https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NovaCore-YouWare.git

# Clean up
cd ..
rm -rf NovaCore-mirror.git
```

## Step 3: Clone the New Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NovaCore-YouWare.git
cd NovaCore-YouWare
```

## Step 4: Add YouWare-Specific Files

The following files are already included in the main repository:
- `youware.json` - Project manifest
- `docs/YOUWARE_SETUP.md` - Setup guide
- `docs/YOUWARE_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment guide
- `docs/YOUWARE_FORK_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - This file

## Step 5: Create YouWare-Specific README

Create `README_YOUWARE.md`:

```markdown

3. **Pages** (optional):
   - Enable GitHub Pages for documentation

## Step 7: Create Release

```bash
# Tag the release
git tag -a v1.0.0-youware -m "NovaCore v1.0.0 optimized for YouWare"

# Push tag
git push origin v1.0.0-youware
```

Then create release on GitHub:
1. Go to Releases
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Select tag `v1.0.0-youware`
4. Add release notes
5. Publish release

## Step 8: Add to YouWare Community

   - **Tags**: ai, business, dashboard, analytics, crm, erp, react, express
   - **Category**: Business Tools / Productivity
4. Upload screenshot/thumbnail
5. Submit for community review

## Step 9: Maintain Synchronization

To keep fork updated with main repository:

```bash
# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/GEMDevEng/NovaCore.git

# Fetch updates
git fetch upstream

# Merge updates
git merge upstream/main

# Push to fork
git push origin main
```

Or create a GitHub Action for automatic sync:

Create `.github/workflows/sync.yml`:

```yaml
name: Sync with upstream

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Sync upstream
        run: |
          git config user.name "GitHub Action"
          git config user.email "action@github.com"
          git remote add upstream https://github.com/GEMDevEng/NovaCore.git
          git fetch upstream
          git merge upstream/main
          git push origin main
```

## Step 10: Document YouWare-Specific Changes

Create `YOUWARE_CHANGES.md`:

```markdown

- `youware.json` - Project manifest for YouWare platform
- `docs/YOUWARE_SETUP.md` - Setup guide
