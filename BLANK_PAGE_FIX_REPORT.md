# Blank Page Issue - Root Cause & Fix

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Issue**: https://novacore-frontend-seven.vercel.app/ displays blank page  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Awaiting Vercel Redeploy

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
The application was displaying a blank page because the JavaScript bundles were not loading. Investigation revealed:

```bash
$ curl -I https://novacore-frontend-seven.vercel.app/assets/index-B8RRMGts.js

HTTP/2 200 
content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8  ❌ WRONG!
content-length: 2033
```

The JavaScript asset was being served as **HTML** instead of **JavaScript**!

### Why This Happened
The `vercel.json` routing configuration had a catch-all SPA rule that was too broad:

```json
// BEFORE (Broken)
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "status": 404
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",           // ❌ This catches EVERYTHING
      "dest": "/index.html"     // Including /assets/...
    }
  ]
}
```

**Problem**: The catch-all route `/(.*)`  matches `/assets/index-B8RRMGts.js` and rewrites it to `/index.html`, causing the browser to receive HTML instead of JavaScript.

---

## The Fix

Added an explicit route for static assets **before** the catch-all SPA rule:

```json
// AFTER (Fixed)
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/assets/(.*)",    // ✅ Match assets first
      "dest": "/assets/$1"      // Serve them directly
    },
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "status": 404
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",           // ✅ Now only catches non-asset routes
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

**How it works**:
1. Routes are processed in order
2. `/assets/*` files are served directly (not rewritten)
3. `/api/*` requests return 404
4. Everything else → `/index.html` (SPA routing)

## Commit

**Commit Hash**: `3571edc`  
**Message**: "fix: Add explicit route for /assets to prevent SPA routing from catching static files"

---

## Expected Result After Redeploy

```bash
$ curl -I https://novacore-frontend-seven.vercel.app/assets/index-B8RRMGts.js

HTTP/2 200 
content-type: application/javascript  ✅ CORRECT!
content-length: 2833
```

The browser will then:
1. ✅ Load the HTML page
2. ✅ Load the JavaScript bundle
3. ✅ Execute React and render the application
4. ✅ Display the NovaCore dashboard

---

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for Vercel to redeploy** (usually 1-2 minutes after push)
2. **Refresh the browser** at https://novacore-frontend-seven.vercel.app
3. **Verify the application loads** with the dashboard visible

If the page is still blank after 5 minutes:
- Check browser DevTools Console for errors
- Verify the asset content-type is now `application/javascript`
- Check Vercel deployment logs for build errors

---

## Technical Details

**Root Cause**: Overly broad SPA routing rule  
**Impact**: All static assets served as HTML, breaking the application  
**Solution**: Explicit asset routing with proper route ordering  
**Severity**: Critical (prevents application from loading)  
**Fix Complexity**: Simple (4-line configuration change)
