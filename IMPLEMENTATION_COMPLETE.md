### 4. File Structure

#### Frontend Views
```
views/
├── Dashboard.tsx      (Dashboard section)
├── Analytics.tsx      (Analytics with charts)
├── Reports.tsx        (Reports with filtering & export)
├── Calendar.tsx       (Calendar with event management)
└── Contacts.tsx       (Contacts with CRUD operations)
```

#### Backend Routes
```
backend/src/routes/
├── analytics.js       (Analytics endpoints)
├── reports.js         (Reports endpoints)
├── calendar.js        (Calendar endpoints)
├── leads.js           (Leads endpoints - existing)
├── ai.js              (AI endpoints - existing)
└── health.js          (Health check - existing)
```

### 5. Key Features

✅ **Responsive Design**: All sections work on mobile, tablet, and desktop
✅ **Dark Mode Support**: Full dark mode styling with Tailwind CSS
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages and loading states
✅ **API Integration**: Real-time data fetching from backend
✅ **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete for contacts, events, and reports
✅ **Data Filtering**: Advanced filtering by date range, source, and type
✅ **Data Export**: CSV export functionality for reports
✅ **Navigation**: Smooth routing between all sections
✅ **Active States**: Visual feedback for current section in sidebar

### 6. Build Status

✅ **Frontend Build**: Successful (npm run build)
✅ **Backend Syntax**: Valid (node -c checks passed)
✅ **No Errors**: Clean build with no compilation errors
✅ **Bundle Size**: 1.6MB (warning about large chunks - can be optimized with code splitting)

### 7. API Base URL

All frontend API calls use:
```
https://backend-q4s5npax9-gem-devs-projects.vercel.app/api/v1
```

This is configured in each view component for easy updates.

### 8. Testing Recommendations

1. **Navigation Testing**
   - Click each sidebar link and verify correct view loads
   - Verify active state highlighting works
   - Test browser back/forward buttons

2. **API Integration Testing**
   - Verify all API calls return correct data
   - Test error handling with invalid requests
   - Check CORS headers are properly configured

3. **Functionality Testing**
   - Add/edit/delete operations for contacts and events
   - Filter and search functionality
   - CSV export for reports
   - Calendar navigation and event management

4. **UI/UX Testing**
   - Responsive design on different screen sizes
   - Dark mode toggle functionality
   - Loading states and error messages
   - Form validation

### 9. Deployment Instructions

#### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy dist/ folder to Vercel
```

#### Backend Deployment (Vercel)
```bash
cd backend
# Backend is already configured for Vercel in vercel.json
# Deploy to Vercel
```
