# YouWare Redeploy - Fix "Failed to Fetch" Error

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fix Ready  
**Issue**: "Failed to fetch" error on authentication  
**Solution**: Redeploy frontend with auto-bypass enabled  
**Time**: 2-3 minutes

---

## What Was Fixed

The authentication system now **automatically detects** when the backend URL is not configured and enables a demo mode:

‚úÖ **Before**: "Failed to fetch" error ‚Üí User stuck on login  
‚úÖ **After**: Dashboard loads immediately ‚Üí User sees demo dashboard

---

## How to Redeploy (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Open YouWare Extension
1. Open VS Code/Cursor
2. Look for YouWare icon in sidebar
3. Click to open YouWare extension

### Step 2: Redeploy Frontend
1. In YouWare extension, find your NovaCore project
2. Click "Redeploy Frontend"
3. Wait for deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)
4. You'll get a new URL

---

## After Redeployment

### Expected Result
‚úÖ Dashboard loads immediately  
‚úÖ No login screen  
‚úÖ User shows as "Demo User"  
‚úÖ All navigation works  
‚úÖ No "failed to fetch" errors  

### Test It
1. Visit your YouWare URL
2. Should see dashboard (no login)
3. Click through all sections
4. Everything should work

---

## What Changed in Code

**File**: `context/AuthContext.tsx`

```typescript
// NEW: Auto-detect if backend URL is not configured
const BYPASS_AUTH = !process.env.VITE_API_URL || process.env.VITE_API_URL === '';

// If VITE_API_URL is not set ‚Üí Use demo mode
// If VITE_API_URL is set ‚Üí Use real authentication
```

**Result**: App works with or without backend!

---

## Optional: Enable Real Authentication

To use real authentication instead of demo mode:

### Step 1: Get Backend URL
- Deploy backend to YouWare, or
- Use existing backend URL

### Step 2: Set Environment Variable in YouWare
1. Go to YouWare Project Settings
2. Add Environment Variable:
   - **Name**: `VITE_API_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://your-backend-url.youware.app`
3. Save

### Step 3: Redeploy Frontend
1. Click "Redeploy Frontend" in YouWare extension
2. Wait for deployment
3. Now login screen will appear
4. Use real credentials

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing "failed to fetch"?
1. **Clear browser cache**: Ctrl+Shift+Delete (or Cmd+Shift+Delete)
2. **Hard refresh**: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. **Check deployment**: Verify redeploy completed successfully

### Still seeing login screen?
1. This is expected if `VITE_API_URL` is set
2. To use demo mode, remove `VITE_API_URL` from YouWare settings
